# Podcast Transcript Opinion Mining: Who is the Next President?
## Overview
This project aims to predict the next president by analyzing opinions expressed in political podcasts. By applying opinion mining techniques to podcast transcripts, we gauge public sentiment towards various presidential candidates. This process involves multiple stages, from preprocessing transcripts to sentiment analysis, ultimately providing insights into which candidate is likely to win based on public opinions.

## Project Objectives
Preprocess Transcripts: Clean and normalize the provided text transcripts to prepare them for sentiment analysis.
Opinion Mining: Use advanced natural language processing techniques to identify sentiments and opinions expressed about presidential candidates.
Predictive Analysis: Aggregate sentiment data to predict which candidate is likely to become the next president based on public opinion trends.
## Project Workflow
1. Text Preprocessing
Cleaning: Remove irrelevant information such as filler words and transcription errors.
Normalization: Standardize the text by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, and handling contractions and abbreviations.
2. Sentiment Analysis (Opinion Mining)
Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or phrases for easier analysis.
Sentiment Detection: Apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral towards each presidential candidate.
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: Focus on specific topics or aspects mentioned in the podcasts to determine the sentiment associated with each candidate.
Prompt Engineering: Utilize prompt engineering on the Mistral model to provide sentiment scores and detailed descriptions explaining the reasons behind those sentiment scores.
3. Predictive Analysis
Data Aggregation: Aggregate sentiment data from multiple podcast episodes to identify trends over time.
Trend Analysis: Analyze changes in public opinion and sentiment towards each candidate.
Prediction: Use the aggregated sentiment data to predict the most likely candidate to win the presidential election.
Tools and Technologies
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis.
Prompt Engineering: Techniques applied to the Mistral model for enhanced sentiment scoring and explanation.
Data Visualization: Tools like Matplotlib or Tableau for visualizing sentiment trends and predictions.
Machine Learning: Algorithms for trend analysis and prediction.
# Conclusion
By leveraging podcast transcript opinion mining and prompt engineering, this project provides a unique approach to predicting the next president based on public opinion expressed in political podcasts. The combination of advanced NLP, prompt engineering, and predictive analysis offers valuable insights into the dynamics of electoral sentiment.
